With the increased support for macOS by financial and government institutions, I boldly use Macmini as a home server, thinking that macOS is sufficient. (~~There's also the reason that the Ubuntu Mini PC died~~).

Setting up a public IP is burdensome and requires a lot of configuration, so I use Tailscale as a VPN, which was free and easiest to set up, allowing ssh access only between registered devices via private IP. For development-related work, I use ssh, and for cases requiring GUI, I use the built-in Screen Sharing on macOS. 

However, there were times when the Mac mini went into sleep mode and the server did not respond to pings due to disk sleep.  I was sad to leave my Mac mini at home and come to work, but thanks to the MacOS option

```
Wake for network access:
While sleeping, your Mac can receive incoming network traffic, such as iMessages and other iCloud updates, to keep your applications up to date
```

there was an amazing escape route where I could attach via ssh when the disk was briefly activated at 3-5 minute intervals. And I found the appropriate setting to use Macmini as a server.

The script is below. (The source is included in the script.)

Of course, I didn't activate all the options! Use it to your taste.
